In my data analysis projects, I have successfully applied K-Means clustering to customer segmentation using Python and the scikit-learn library. Leveraging the 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score' features from a dataset, I employed the KMeans algorithm to categorize customers into distinct clusters. The choice of the number of clusters was guided by the business requirements. After fitting the model, I incorporated cluster labels into the original dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of customer groups. To evaluate the clustering quality, I utilized metrics such as inertia and silhouette score, providing insights into the effectiveness of the clustering approach. Additionally, I visualized the clusters on a 2D plot, enhancing the interpretability of the results. This experience showcases my proficiency in unsupervised learning techniques and my ability to extract meaningful insights from data for strategic decision-making.
