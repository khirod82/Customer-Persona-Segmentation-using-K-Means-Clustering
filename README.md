We are using K-means on the Mall customer dataset. Based on the Descriptive and Prescriptive studies so far, we have formed a persona and identified the main problems and opportunity. Our Ideal Customers are promoters with high annual income and gender is woman consumer in her late 20s to early 30s. We have also found that age is negatively correlated to spending score. To find our set customer segments whom we should be spending our time we have to be aware of segments which could any combination between high spending, low spending, average spending with various distributions of income and age. This can be done for both genders individually or together. Clustering is a tool which enable us to group similar objects it is a based on the idea of learning by observations. K means is a distance-based cluster analysis method. As it is not a credible method of grouping numerical data like Age, Spending Score and Annual Income with and nominal data like gender we will skip gender from the segmentation.
